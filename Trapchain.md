Overview
Please provide the following:

A brief description of the project. Trapchain is a music streaming parachain built into Substrate via Kusama that provides native royalty payments.
An indication of how you will integrate this project into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama. 
Use Substrate to launch MVP to Kusama, then to Polkadot.
An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project. My team and I are creatives, Music, DJ'ing, Digital Multi-media designers and Motion graphics as well as software engineers.
We're passionate about crypto and creating artwork for the blockchain community and contributing in moving the space forward innovating in new niche marketplaces.
Project Details
We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.

Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

Mockups/designs of any UI components
API specifications of the core functionality
An overview of the technology stack to be used
Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture etc. to be deployed
PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
Ecosystem Fit
Are there any other projects similar to yours? Ujo, DAORecords... If so, how is your project different? They're building on Ethereum, we plan to build for interoperability on multiple parachains/sidechains.

Development Roadmap ðŸ”©
This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an example roadmap. In the descriptions it should be clear how the project is related to Substrate and/or Polkadot. We recommend that the scope of the work can fit within a 3 month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 month = 1 milestone.

For each milestone:

Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of detail must be enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.
Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone.
Please note that we require documentation (e.g. HOW-TO: NFTYCO tutorials, SPOTIFY API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
Please commit to providing a dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
Please indicate the milestone duration, as well as number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, 
and include the number of days along with their cost per day.

Number	Deliverable	Specification
0a.	License	Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicense
0b.	Documentation	We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Trapchain nodes. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works.
0c.	Testing Guide	The code will have proper unit-test coverage (e.g. 90%) to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide we will describe how to run these tests
1.	Trapchain module: X	We will create a Trapchain module that will... (Please list the functionality that will be coded for the first milestone)
2.	Trapchain module: Y	We will create a Trapchain module that will...
3.	Trapchain module: Z	We will create a Trapchain module that will...
4.	Trapchain chain	Modules X, Y & Z of our custom chain will interact in such a way... (Please describe the deliverable here as detailed as possible)
5.	Docker	We will provide a dockerfile to demonstrate the full functionality of our chain
Milestone 2 Example â€” Additional features
...

Community engagement
As part of the Program, we require that you produce an article/tutorial and publish it (for example on Medium). 
It should explain your work done as part of the grant.

Normally, we ask you to submit the write-up upon the completion of your grant, 
although for larger projects it might make sense to publish multiple articles after the completion of different milestones.

Future Plans
Please include the team's long-term plans and intentions. Long-term plan are to allow all Trapchain artists all over the world to participate in this interoperability ecosystem.
