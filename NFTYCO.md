Development Roadmap üî©
Below we provide an example roadmap. In the descriptions it should be clear how the project is related to Substrate and/or Polkadot. We recommend that the scope of the work can fit within a 3 month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 month = 1 milestone.

For each milestone:

Please be sure to include a specification of the software
The level of detail must be enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.
Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone.
Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone.
This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
Please provide a test suite
comprising unit and integration tests
along with a guide on how to run these.
Please commit to providing a dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
Please indicate the milestone duration
as well as number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, 
and include the number of days along with their cost per day.

Community engagement
As part of the Program, we require that you produce an article/tutorial and publish it (for example on Medium).
It should explain your work done as part of the grant.

Normally, we ask you to submit the write-up upon the completion of your grant,
although for larger projects it might make sense to publish multiple articles after the completion of different milestones.
