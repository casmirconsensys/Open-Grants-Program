The NFTYCO¬Æ collection is a melange of CyberPunk inspired 3D EVA Printable Models and the background inset of the Sneaker Collectible itself has provided a panel for the display of the Artwork.
This is a shoe that is not only the artwork but in and of itself is a tokenized asset that exists as a Backable NFT that can be owned by a ‚Äúdecentralized autonomous org‚Äù like owning stocks and bonds within a shoe.

An indication of how you will integrate this project into Harmony.

Integrate non-fungible tokens (NFT) in our game world in the form of game items. Also, add ability to create and deploy smart contracts by players to enhance their base or automate things. Run mainnet on Harmony and connect to Polkadot as a parachain.

Front End provides Web UI for everyone to interact with the SNKRDAO network. All the users need to do is open the webpage deployed by the SNKRDAO Labs team or by users themselves and click the buttons following the manual. Front End will provide such functionalities as creating a new DAO, define a new DAO template, withdraw personal assets, voting in DAO, and so on. Front End will be built with NodeJS.
SNKRDAO Token $SNKR is the native token of the SNKRDAO Network, and it will play the role of governance and other utilities. $SNKR is necessary to secure and power the SNKRDAO Network. The SNKRDAO Network may hold an IPO and reward community members for helping our auction with $SNKR tokens during the Parachain Auction.

Template Library is the key component of the SNKRDAO network. It is comprised of multiple contracts. The main functionalities of Template Library are managing and providing various DAO Templates for different types of organizations. Everyone has the right to define new DAO Templates according to their needs, and the SNKRDAO network provides some default DAO Templates such as Voting Template, Fund Template, SneakerVC (Venture Capital) Template and so on.
Asset Vault is the smart contract providing the basic features of managing assets for each DAO. Working together with DAO Template, the Asset Vault manages all kinds of assets, including the assets needed by creating a new DAO, the assets deposited by the governors of a DAO, and other assets.

Development Roadmap üî©
Below we provide an example roadmap. In the descriptions it should be clear how the project is related to Substrate. We recommend that the scope of the work can fit within a 3 month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 month = 1 milestone.

For each milestone:

Please be sure to include a specification of the software
The level of detail must be enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.
Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone.
Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone.
This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
Please provide a test suite
comprising unit and integration tests
along with a guide on how to run these.
Please commit to providing a dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
Please indicate the milestone duration
as well as number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, 
and include the number of days along with their cost per day.
