Development Roadmap 🔩
This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.
A new record label for a new metaverse® Digital Music Payment & Streaming Service for Artists
The old model of a record label is slavery.
Artists deserve ownership over their mastery.
Streams robs the artist of reaping the rewards of their royalties.

Below we provide an example roadmap. In the descriptions it should be clear how the project is related to Substrate and/or Polkadot. We recommend that the scope of the work can fit within a 3 month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 month = 1 milestone.

For each milestone:

Please be sure to include a specification of your software. Treat it as a contract - the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification. To assist you in defining it, we created a document with examples for some grant categories here.
Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone.
Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
Please commit to providing a dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
Please indicate the milestone duration, as well as number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, and include the number of days along with their cost per day.
Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory and should not be removed, unless you explicitly specify a reason within the PR's Additional Notes section (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test)
Overview
Total Estimated Duration: Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
Full-time equivalent (FTE): Workload of an employed person (see) (e.g. 2 FTE)
Total Costs: Amount of Payment in BTC for the whole project. The total amount of funding needs to be below $30k at the time of submission. (e.g. 0.80 BTC)
Milestone 1 Example — Implement Substrate Modules
Estimated Duration: 1 month
FTE: 1
Costs: 0.75 BTC
Number	Deliverable	Specification
0a.	License	Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicense
0b.	Documentation	We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works.
0c.	Testing Guide	The code will have unit-test coverage (min. 70%) to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide we will describe how to run these tests
0d.	Article/Tutorial	We will write an article or tutorial that explains the work done as part of the grant.
1.	Substrate module: X	We will create a Substrate module that will... (Please list the functionality that will be coded for the first milestone)
2.	Substrate module: Y	We will create a Substrate module that will...
3.	Substrate module: Z	We will create a Substrate module that will...
4.	Substrate chain	Modules X, Y & Z of our custom chain will interact in such a way... (Please describe the deliverable here as detailed as possible)
5.	Docker	We will provide a dockerfile to demonstrate the full functionality of our chain

TrapCha.in assumes the network is constantly under attack of DDOS and therefore does not seek to “Validate and Store State” but Only holds a public ledger of Malicious Attack Vector addresses and stores them in a Blacklist Smart Contract and therefore doesn’t keep a record of valid transactions only the ones that have been slashed or “Violates the consensus”. Thus crafting a smaller more nimble protocol based on Zero-knowledge proofs and Violatr Nodes. 
Node Operators earn “trapcoin” for vigilance in violating bad actors and thus the reward system is robust against attackers because the assumption is that it is always under attack for safety and security precautions as opposed to the idealism and utopic validators and turns every node into a Violator node constantly raising the bar on effectively re-structuring the security acumen of nodes.

Two-chain commit rules are used in [PBFT 1999], [Tendermint 2016] and [Casper 2017]. They differ in their proposer mechanisms. PBFT justifies a proposer not having a highest QC, Tendermint and Casper wait the maximal network delay for a proposer to collect the highest QC.

Possible additional information to include:

What work has been done so far?
Are there are any teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project?
Have you applied for other grants so far?
